<h1>Example Webpage</h1>
<pre>--<i>made using stollen</i>--

This webpage is made using stollen.

The name is stollen becuase I stole most of the idea from<a href="https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/pollen">pollen</a>.

And because I didn't want to just use<a href="https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/pollen">pollen</a>because I didn't want to learn racket. (And I wanted to learn how to make simple compiler)</pre>
<h1>What is Stollen?</h1>
<pre>Stollen is a simple markup language.

It's syntax is like this</pre>
<pre><code>outter text

{! attribute1 attribute2 attribute3 }[
	body text 
	{! child_attr1 child_attr2}[child text!]
!]

outter text</code></pre>
<pre></pre>
<h1>Why not just use html?</h1>
<pre>There are number of different advantages over using plain html.</pre>
<ul>
<li>Less Typing</li>
<li>Easier to read than plain html</li>
<li>More flexible since Stollen document converts to js objects</li>
</ul>

<h1>What about markdown?</h1>
<pre>Markdown is fine but I think it lacks flexibility.</pre>
